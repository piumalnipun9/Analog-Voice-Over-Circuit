# **Analog Voice-Over Circuit with Channel Prioritization**

This project demonstrates a fully analog implementation of a **Voice-Over Circuit** that effectively handles **two audio channels**, with automatic prioritization of the active channel.

## **Key Features**

- **Channel Prioritization**  
  Automatically prioritizes one channel when an input is detected, ensuring the most important channel is always heard.

- **Independent Volume Control**  
  Allows separate volume adjustments for both channels to tailor the audio output to specific needs.

- **Detection Threshold**  
  Adjustable detection threshold to ensure precise activation based on audio intensity.

- **Purely Analog Design**  
  Developed entirely using basic analog components and ICs, without digital processors, ensuring high-fidelity signal processing.

## **Functionality**

### ðŸ”° **Band-Pass Filter**  
The journey begins with a **band-pass filter**, which effectively improves the audio signal by reducing unwanted feedback and filtering out high-frequency noise. This step ensures that only the desired frequency range passes through for further processing.

### ðŸ”° **Pre-Amplifier**  
The filtered signal is then fed to a **pre-amplifier**, which boosts the signal to a level suitable for detection by the subsequent **peak detector circuit**. This ensures that the signal strength is sufficient for accurate analysis.

### ðŸ”° **Peak Detector Circuit**  
The **peak detector** captures the maximum amplitude of the audio signal, providing a stable DC output that is proportional to the peak amplitude. This step ensures that the highest level of the signal is preserved for accurate evaluation.

### ðŸ”° **Comparator Circuit**  
Next, the output from the peak detector is evaluated by a **comparator**. The comparator compares the peak value against a **predetermined threshold** and produces a high output when the signal surpasses this threshold. This decision determines whether audio from one channel or another should be activated.

### ðŸ”° **Control Signal for Switching**  
The **comparator's output** serves as a control signal to efficiently switch between the microphone input and the audio input. The priority channel is selected based on the detection of audio input.

### ðŸ”° **Main Amplifier**  
The final step involves the **main amplifier**, which amplifies the selected audio signal to a level that can be clearly heard through the **speaker**. The amplification ensures the output is loud and clear.
